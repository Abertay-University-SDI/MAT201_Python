# MAT201 Python workbook

Contained in these pages are a series of Python notebooks, designed to accompany various lectures and topics which occur in the MAT201 "Applied Mathematics 2" undergraduate lecture course, forming part of the Computer Games Technology (BSc) degree programme at Abertay University.

These notebooks illustrate the use of certain mathematical concepts, implemented in the Python coding language. Python is often capable of handling and visualing specific mathematical problems with ease, so these notebooks complement the formal mathematics taught in lectures, showing how Python solves problems or can visualise the process being taught in lectures. These pages are not to be used in examination, and are not currently formally assessed. A brief introduction to the Python progamming language is given at the beginning of the workbook.

All code was authored and written by Dr James Threlfall based on problems proposed in workbook or his own lectures and tutorials carried out in MAT201 (2023).
