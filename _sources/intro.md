# Welcome

This is a collection of Python Jupyter notebooks, designed to complement various aspects of content covered in the Applied Mathematics 2 course MAT201, as part of the undergraduate Computer Games Technology (CGT) students at Abertay University.

MAT201 aims to give you an understanding of the mathematics that underpins various aspects of CGT. The routines demonstrated here illustrate how Python (and other computational languages) can be used to see this mathematics in action. 

The MAT201 examination will evaluate your understanding of this mathematics, formulating solutions to mathematical problems using pen and paper. These notebooks and routines do *NOT* replace the mathematical approaches shown in the lectures, and should not be used in the exam under any circumstances. See    
[MAT201 MyLearningSpace pages](https://mylearningspace.abertay.ac.uk/d2l/home/22667) for more information related to the MAT201 course.
