# Summary

This series of interactive Python notebooks has hopefully given you another way to think about the dynamics content taught in MAT201. 

Some workbooks have demonstrated how Python achieves the same solutions as those found by hand, solved through symbolic computation. Other workbooks saw a practical implementation of the mathematics, illustrating animations of dynamic behaviour underpinned by the maths introduced in lectures. After you have completed MAT201, you will likely use codes (potentially even Python!) to perform much of this mathematics for you, often without even realising. I hope that this interactive tool has provided insight about how fundamental this mathematics is in the dynamic behaviour of objects of all shapes and sizes.
